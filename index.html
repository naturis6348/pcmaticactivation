        <p>
            If you’ve just downloaded or purchased PC Matic, one of the most important things to do is complete the PC Matic activation process. This guide will walk you through the steps to activate PC Matic on your Windows or macOS device, ensuring your system is fully protected with PC Matic’s proactive security features.
        </p>

        <h2>Why PC Matic Activation Is Important</h2>
        <p>
            PC Matic activation is essential to unlock the full features of the software. Until you activate your license, PC Matic’s real-time protection, malware removal, and system optimization features may be restricted or unavailable. Completing the activation validates your subscription and links your device to your PC Matic account.
        </p>

        <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Activate PC Matic</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Download and Install PC Matic:</strong>  
                Start by downloading PC Matic from the official website. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen prompts to install the software on your device.

            <li><strong>Launch the PC Matic Application:</strong>  
                After installation, open PC Matic. You’ll be greeted with a login or registration screen. If you already have an account, use your PC Matic login credentials. If not, select the registration option.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Register or Log In:</strong>  
                - If you're a new user, click on “Register” and enter your email, create a secure password, and follow the instructions to set up your account.<br>
                - If you already have an account, simply log in with your credentials.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Enter Your PC Matic License Key:</strong>  
                After login or registration, you’ll be prompted to enter your PC Matic activation key. This is a 20-digit license key provided at the time of purchase.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Complete the Activation:</strong>

            </li>
            <li><strong>Run Your First Scan:</strong>
